/**
 * The header on the signed-out pages: the lockup alone, sitting on the page
 * ground at the top-left corner.
 *
 * It carries no fill, no hairline and no sticky position, unlike the signed-in
 * top bar. That bar earns its surface — it spans a sidebar, holds the org
 * selector and account controls, and content scrolls under it. Here there is
 * only a logo, so a translucent slab across the top just laid a second, darker
 * band over the atmosphere and read as a strip bolted onto the page.
 *
 * The gutters match the app's top bar rather than the auth column's 1200px
 * measure, so the logo lands in the same place whether you are signed in or
 * out. Aligning it to the form column instead would have floated it into the
 * middle of a wide screen.
